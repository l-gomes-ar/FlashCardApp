# Overview

I decided to try using JetPack Compose to build my first Android app.

This app is a simple Flashcard application, where the user can add cards to a set (collection), and use it for studying and memorising concepts.

# Future Work

* Ability to edit and delete cards from collections.
* Store data in local storage so is persists even if the app closes.
